# Create project folder
mkdir user-data-display
cd user-data-display
Save all three files in the same directory:

index.html

styles.css

script.js

Open the application:

Double-click index.html to open in your browser

Or use VS Code Live Server extension

Use the application:

Data loads automatically on page load

Click "Fetch User Data" to manually fetch

Click "Reload Data" to refresh the information

**üéØ How It Works**

Data Flow:
Request: Application sends GET request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

Response: API returns JSON array of user objects

Processing: JavaScript parses JSON and extracts relevant data

Display: User cards are dynamically created and displayed

Key Functions:
fetchUserData() - Handles API requests and error handling

displayUsers() - Creates and displays user cards

showStatus() - Shows loading/error/success messages

üß™ Testing
